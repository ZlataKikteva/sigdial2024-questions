"particularly the biggest uncertainty there are a lot of positives at the moment, aren't there",Rhetorical Questioning
should we not have come up with some kind of better system by now a year in,Rhetorical Questioning
Have you made any plans,Pure Questioning
"what you can't be is selfish and keep it all for yourself, you know",Assertive Questioning
isn't that the crux of the matter,Rhetorical Questioning
"So to not vaccinate everyone here, vaccinate some people here, all the adults, and then start sending abroad",Assertive Questioning
so how much confidence can we have in those negotiations?,Assertive Questioning
"Adam, is when is that opportunity",Pure Questioning
When is that moment,Pure Questioning
"if we were to follow what Nigel's suggesting, that we should be helping other countries, when could that be",Pure Questioning
do you think the government is right to suggest that we should vaccinate our entire population before we start thinking about shipping some of our vaccines out to other countries,Pure Questioning
"would you be prepared to give up your vaccine, say, Camilla, for another country",Pure Questioning
So what does that mean in practice,Pure Questioning
you don't support the one per cent then,Pure Questioning
"do you think here in the UK, we should vaccinate our own population first before we start exporting vaccines",Pure Questioning
That is what we're going to do,Rhetorical Questioning
"one per cent wouldn't be enough, by your definition?",Rhetorical Questioning

What kind of world and what kind of Wales do we want to build,Rhetorical Questioning
What about them,Pure Questioning
"And presumably, Andrew, you don't think that the Conservatives are going to benefit from 16 to 17-year-olds voting because you called it a stitch-up by the left wing political establishment",Pure Questioning
So is it going to be a bit tricky for you to appeal to them now,Pure Questioning
"Vaughan, Scotland's rather outmanoeuvred you, hasn't it",Assertive Questioning
it's been very hard for you to say…I know you might be worth four per cent in Scotland but you're not worth four per cent in Wales,Assertive Questioning
"What, you think there's not an element of politics in it",Pure Questioning
what about a four per cent pay rise,Pure Questioning
Are you more likely to vote Labour,Pure Questioning
Do you think this is a good idea,Pure Questioning
"they should deserve it, you know",Assertive Questioning
"Is it a turnoff for you, Kay",Pure Questioning
"in the forthcoming May elections, which political party will benefit the most from 16 and 17-year-olds being able to vote",Pure Questioning

Why does anybody need to vote for you,Pure Questioning
"Do you want that uncertainty, Keith",Pure Questioning
"Shouldn't the Scottish government, I want to ask Keith Brown, take the power focus…focus on power away from it",Rhetorical Questioning
and do welfare to Scottish population,Rhetorical Questioning
what does that mean for who gets to decide on the recovery?,Pure Questioning
why do you think more people aren't listening to your message,Pure Questioning
the Brexiteer Tories in London or a government in Scotland that we've actually voted for,Rhetorical Questioning
why don't you answer the question about if there's a majority in parliament,Rhetorical Questioning
isn't that enough,Assertive Questioning

what's your perspective,Pure Questioning
"How does each party view the long-term future for oil and gas workers, with plans to scale back production in the new future, given the number of people in Scotland who desperately rely on it, especially younger workers",Pure Questioning
Are you also going to pledge them to phase out fossil fuels within ten years,Pure Questioning
"when do you intend oil and gas production to stop, Keith",Pure Questioning
do you just accept that Boris has got a veto over the things that we want to try [voices overlap 19:24] of our country,Rhetorical Questioning

how do you view the long-term future of oil and gas workers,Pure Questioning
how can anyone actually work out how you're going to find the money for the whole term,Pure Questioning
what's your answer to that,Pure Questioning
So when do you think,Pure Questioning

"it's not an option at all at the moment, is it",Assertive Questioning
Do you think that's likely,Pure Questioning
"how would you, kind of, see that the investment where you're going to place it is going to respond to any of these issues",Pure Questioning
Where's the money coming from,Pure Questioning
Have you not said that's going to have to come from within the existing NHS budget,Assertive Questioning
"how are you paying for it, Keith?",Rhetorical Questioning
where are you going to get the money from,Pure Questioning
Why are we still in 2021 struggling with good Wi-Fi signals in many parts of Scotland,Rhetorical Questioning

"why do you think Labour has not appealed to them, in the numbers that you'd like to see",Pure Questioning
"The UK government isn't giving consent at the moment with no sign of when it's going to do so, so how are you going to resolve this",Pure Questioning
"can I just say how ridiculous that situation is, that Boris Johnson again, the leader of a party that has been rejected consistently in Scotland since 1955, is telling the people of Scotland that have just voted overwhelmingly for pro-independence MSPs that there is no",Assertive Questioning
how are you going to resolve it,Pure Questioning
"this union, one based on a partnership of consent, or does it only exist through force of law",Pure Questioning
the question is do they have a mandate,Pure Questioning
Do I think that they have established the consensus to have a referendum now,Pure Questioning
Why on earth would you start contemplating constitutional and argue about issues of separation,Rhetorical Questioning
what planet are you on,Rhetorical Questioning
