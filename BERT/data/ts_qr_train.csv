What can the panel suggest for a whole generation of school children who are now missing nearly half an academic year and face months of distrust about social distancing and social contact and the face of further disruption There's obviously some schools are going to go back on 1st June Some are not What's happening where you are,Pure Questioning
What's happening where you are It is a mixed picture some are going back Some have said they would rather take their time to get the right arrangements in place we want to get the kids back in school if we can as quickly as possible it's got to be done as safely as possible The key thing is here schools haven't closed It is not as if they have not been doing anything over recent weeks Of course they have been looking after children of key workers teachers are feeling a bit stressed from the teacher-bashing they have seen this week we need to sort of de-escalate this row a little bit,Pure Questioning
Do you think it would be more likely to be successful if head teachers had known about 1 June before it was announced to the nation at large when they heard it on television? There are thousands of head teachers and tens of hundreds of thousands of teachers it is hard to announce it to tens of thousands of people,Pure Questioning
Why not? ,Rhetorical Questioning
"You don't have some of the fears we have heard from teachers and some of the unions No I have been impressed by schools how they are going to social distance the children We have had a massive dossier for the eldest, washing hands, having temperature checks at the door and how they are going to be separated in class",Pure Questioning
"why was a decision taken then it is very hard to compare the UK with Denmark Denmark is a much smaller country We have a different political system based on much more compromise, consultation we could never send children back to school without deep consultation with teachers' unions, head teachers and also parents they did succeed in sending people back",Pure Questioning

You are saying the only way to tell schools was to do it through a press conference you make an announcement to tens of thousands of head teachers you have made it publically The Unions have been closely consulted about the science They have been on calls where scientific advisers have briefed them on that I would urge teaching unions and their members to positively and constructively engage with schools to find safe ways of going back,Pure Questioning
"Are you confident that it will be the test, track and trace will be fully embedded by June 1st I am a computer science student My experience of software engineering is things do go wrong They go often wrong and we are running out of time If you want to launch an app on the same day that schools open, you are asking for the worst",Pure Questioning

Do you have any concerns about that from the perspective of all of the evidence pointing to children not being badly affected if they do catch it and not seemingly being as infectious as adults considering all of the measures that schools have been put in place to make sure that children are safe considering the fact that they are missing out on so much of their education by being at home all of this is about assessing risk and weighing up the different probabilities on a balance of probabilities overall after now two months at home with us trying to home educate them as well as we can while also working I think that on balance my children are better off in school,Pure Questioning
Do you think the government should help by bailing us out as the country starts to get back on its feet certain industries and certain companies are going to have to -- they can contribute as profitable industries can contribute substantially to the revitalising and the reopening of Britain It is incumbent upon us to sometimes have these difficult conversations with government we need to tell them the specific challenges that we are going to have in order to play that active role in reactivating the economy,Pure Questioning
What are parents supposed to make of that they are probably a bit confused by it all It is a row that has been going on I am not sure that helps parents I would agree with Helle Let head teachers sit in the driving seat and decide when it is safe to open school Parents will probably look most to head teachers for advice about safety of their kids it should also be done in consultation with local councils the circumstances will differ from one place to another in terms of the teaching staff Some of them may be self-isolating There may be issues they have to deal with when we look at the staff There will be physical circumstances at the school,Pure Questioning

"What is the consequence for children who can't go to school. We will have children -- I mean for practically lose a whole year of education.   They have simply can't remember what they learned six months ago. So I am a little bit worried that if you last too long, we will be taking a little bit of the chirp's future twice.  First we will take almost a year of their education an then we are also handing them a very, very large bill for a lockdown which has become very, very expensive. So there is these balances to find but I would just again say find a good balance with also the teachers and take the heat out of it.  but I would just again say find a good balance with also the teachers and take the heat out of it. The only way this can be solved is by being pragmatic",Pure Questioning
"Claire, what do you think of what you have heard? I quite like Helle's idea of using venues creative leave.  I think what I fear is that the value of education will have been taken away from children and I think this is every child.  It is children from reception right up to the 6 formers that have lost out on their 'A' levels and are actually grieveing because of that but also I think what I fear is that there will be a distrust about social contract",Pure Questioning

Having the app is not critical to contact tracing Experience in the Isle of Wight shows you can do effective contatracing without the app the app is helpful it adds something to it and we will get that in a few weeks' time There are all sorts of other innovations happening Matt Hancock talked about a test being deployed today that gives you a result in 20 minutes We have had advances in antibody testing today as well the science is really beginning to catch up with this disease For me the science is really what gives me hope for the future hope we can move beyond the strange circumstances of the last few weeks and return to something of a normal life as the months go by,Pure Questioning
"when can we expect to see the full implementation of test track and trace Full implemenation, according to the government anyway, is critical in terms of easing the lockdown and getting children back to school when are we going to see test, track and trace fully amounted, not just the kind of the beginnings of it, but fully implemented We have seen the new app being tested in the Isle of Wight We have learned from that experience One of the things we have learned is we can effectively deploy test, track and trace with the manual tracers We have recruited 24000 of those already We will be up to the full complement of 25,000 by 1st June the service will be fully operational on 1st June, able to track and trace 10,00from 1st June onwards The app we think will be ready to deploy a few weeks after that the two are complementary the system will work comprehensively from 1st June which is one of the government's critical test You will help us learn more about the way this disease spreads It will help us stop it spreading any further",Pure Questioning

"can you see the government extending a helping hand In terms of what we have done already I would strongly encourage every arts organisation to use all of the existing schemes James mentioned the for other scheme already Every organisation in the position, for example, of theatre should be using that scheme to have their staff who can't work paid at 80% of their Sarl each Government is funding that and has recently extended it There are significant loan schemes available under the government backed loan schemes that have paid out now over £20 billion there is no question the government has made a massive outlay when it comes to support small business There are a lot of people employed in the theatre who can't access the for owe scheme and lot of theatres are saying the loans don't apply to them which is why they are asking for the money Is there anything additional the government can do",Pure Questioning

How could he possibly say to his constituents they were wrong and Dominic Cummings was right",Assertive Questioning
"do you feel compliance may have been undermined by the events of the last few days The question is really about what is the impact of that and what we have heard from our members who are CEOs of hospitals, GPs, all across the health system People are worried that public health messages are being undermined They are already hearing that people are making decisions they might not have otherwise made That's really worrying in order for these public measures, whether lockdown, test, track and trace, any of these things to work, we need to have a really clear message that's not open to too much interpretation and discretion we need to have this public feeling that we are all in it together",Pure Questioning
"Are you worried people may now -- the comment from Keith, ""move on and I don't want to talk about it anymore"" What we have seen so far is people really consciously following guidance the guidance has included recognising that some situations will be more difficult For instance, if you are looking after somebody who is particularly vulnerable, have a childcare situation",Pure Questioning

"Has it had any impact on whether you will be more or less confined as we go into test and protect or test and isolate now no, from a personal level I would follow the guidelines I've got enough integrity to do that it will have an impact on some people who are just fed up with the whole idea that someone can get away with something when the rest are not supposed to",Pure Questioning

"When you don't know all the people you have been closer than 2-metre contact with, without the app how are you going to find them you will find a  lot of people will know people they have spent close contact with for a sustained period of time That's what you would talk through with the tracers So they can contact them This is a known way of dealing with a pandemic and controlling it So we are not making this up This is a system that is known to work",Pure Questioning
"Is that what your constituents were saying to you when it when it first broke, this story I have received e-mails from constituents every MP has constituents who have talked about some of the sacrifices they have made and things they have missed out on I don't think we should suggest for a moment that lockdown is anything other than very hard what's really important is that we now have the infection rate under control and falling we are in a position to ease some of the lockdown measures launching NHS test and trace referred to by Alison that is so important to continuing to keep it under control we can get life going again",Pure Questioning

"Who is managing it better I don’t think you can treat this as a competition When people continue to lose their lines of business when people continue to be infected at an alarming rate we have to look across the UK there has been a similar approach taken by all four governments Around the world we are a stranger about this virus, a virus that didn’t exist this time last year there have been big mistakes in Scotland we have to accept that and listen to the advice we are hearing and learn from them In Scotland we had people testing positive for Covid-19 in a hospital being discharged into a care home We have to learn from that Nicola Sturgeon told us there would be a support in September we’re still waiting in October for that We have the highest percentage of deaths in the care home setting anywhere in the UK here in Scotland no one can claim a success It is a battle that we are all still fighting It is one that continues to take lives It is one we are still trying to get on top of That’s just the health battle We also have the economic response to deal with as well",Pure Questioning
"Do you think that this pandemic has been managed better by Nicola Sturgeon in Scotland than it has by Boris Johnson in England Well, I don’t think it is a competition because every government is responsible with the trust of the people to manage this pandemic in a way that sees the virus suppressed and also trying to manage the other harms, whether those are economic, social or other health harms We’ve seen from some of the polling, certainly even this week, that, I think, about three-quarters of people in Scotland are satisfied with the way that Nicola Sturgeon has handled the pandemic",Pure Questioning

"Mark, do you want to kick us off with this? Yes, sure. The first thing to say is that this virus transmits in indoor spaces more easily than it does in the outside.  The second thing is that, going back to the last question, the numbers aren’t going down because we’re on average making too many social contacts So we know that lockdown works because when this pandemic started with tight restrictions it did come under control. Restaurants, cafés, it depends, actually, how people are seated. It depends how people behave, whether they are inside or outside. when you read through, and I read through before coming, all the different restrictions, I looked at Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, it is very confusing, and it is different. The bottom line is we need to reduce our social contacts and until we get it down similar to the levels we started with, this is not going to come under control. Frankly, we do need to get on top of the second wave and urgency does matter. we just have to get on with it and I don’t think it is helpful having lots of different hard-to-understand rules.",Pure Questioning

Of course I absolutely do, and have spoken out in the past around things like the travel ban. But at the same time I think we have to recognise this election will take place next week. It’s a decision for the American people. And our relationship with America, it’s not related to one President or one era, it goes back over generations.  There are cultural, political, economic ties, and there are huge challenges around the world, the coronavirus crisis, climate change just to name two of them that we have to work with the winner of this presidential election.

In a week No the comments you refer to were some time ago he expert body who advises on this has published its interim recommendations a few weeks ago it will publish the final recommendations when we get the final data about the vaccine should it be both effective and safe Those are the two critical things that we’ll look into,Rhetorical Questioning
"If people can pay for it, will they get it more quickly I don’t think that’s going to be possible",Pure Questioning
"Does that mean the government is going to buy up all the doses so people won’t be able to go to a private doctor and say I’d like that I don’t foresee this It has been hard enough buying this as a government The deals those who develop the vaccine have done has been with government We have bought on behalf of the whole UK population, then we intend to roll out according to clinical priority",Pure Questioning
Is it less than 50 percent or more than 50 percent ,Pure Questioning
"When will businesses be able to open up and operate normally again the knowledge that there will be a vaccine by the spring let’s say most vulnerable people and older people have been vaccinated by late spring I’m sure the entire economy could open up properly If businesses know that they can move out of this appalling cycle of not knowing what’s going to happen, hyper regulatory activity, lockdown this, curfew this, rules all over the place, up down, up down, not knowing where they are if they can look forward to a future that is linear, where things don’t change all the time, then they can start moving their businesses around to make them work again In that sense it is an absolutely game-changer for business That’s why you saw these astonishing moves in the stock market on Monday when you saw, effectively all the companies geared into the return of normal life, airlines, pubs, etcetera, go completely all the stocks geared into the nightmare we live now, working from home, etcetera, fall significantly the economy will be able to look forward to something more linear, less alcoholic beverage",Pure Questioning

"at the moment you’re not sure there is a big trust issue around vaccines looked at the different surveys you can see that between 7 and 25 percent of people will say they are suspicious of a new vaccine like this there does need to be some kind of campaign around the safety and reminding everybody of the efficacy of the vaccines that we’ve had over the last couple of hundred years It is important to remember back in the 1800s, 20, 30 percent of kids died before they were 5 We put in place a vaccine programme that has brought that down to one in a couple of hundred there is around this idea of trust trust probably a very simple way to make the general population believe in the vaccine and trust in the vaccine at the same time, to increase a little trust in our politicians obviously has fallen off quite substantially over the last 9 months I would suggest that, Matt, you have the vaccine first, and then every other MP has it, and we can rush it out to a couple of top civil servants as well We wait two weeks, everything is fine you can start rolling it out to everybody else",Rhetorical Questioning
"Does the government have any strategies in place to ensure that these pharmaceutical companies give back to the country from their profits to make sure that everybody in the UK who wants the vaccine can have it, rather than being held to ransom or on what they can produce and what the government wants to pay for the vaccine does Mr Hancock think it goes anywhere to increasing an apathetic population who have been drip-fed a series of failures, costly failures and double standards",Pure Questioning
"does Mr Hancock think it goes anywhere to increasing an apathetic population who have been drip-fed a series of failures, costly failures and double standards the arguments are given that the NHS will be able to manage the roll-out the NHS will do it The NHS relies on subcontractors to do the job of rolling it out Recently the vetting has suffered I’ve also heard rumours that there are simply not enough medical grade vials or lorries around or even PPE for the rollout of this vaccine to say the NHS will do it, well, the NHS can only do it if they get the support to do their job it would be a monumental waste of money to buy the vaccine and then not having it transported and it becoming ineffective",Pure Questioning

Fantastic people, including in my own constituency that worked tirelessly to support us. We have a plan, we’re going to do this, we’re going to do it together but this isn’t going to happen overnight. We need to be realistic about that.

"Peter, since we have you here, it is an argument that a number of people have raised, this idea of stratification, as you called it, shielding certain sections of the population, letting others have more freedom, are you convinced by that? we know if we try that then it is going to eventually work its way up to the most vulnerable. There is very good evidence that the most vulnerable are able to screen themselves off still and there’s a declining rate of disease transmission in those most vulnerable people. But we have seen in many locations when you try to allow the rates to go up a little bit in order to open businesses, inevitably it does percolate through into the vulnerability population. It is a difficult problem. I hope we can get the vaccines into those vulnerable populations so that effect won’t occur.",Pure Questioning

It doesn’t provide the economic advice or the other advice.  But I ask the critical thing is now everyone has to recognise that this lockdown is really serious.  It is not only what the rules are but the way people obey them that matters as well.

"You wouldn't let them open earlier Unless the data indicates that is safe I want to underline a point We saw the change in restrictions being announced about a week ago now we didn't hear what support was going to be available for those businesses that were affected It is now, what, the fifth time that happens a particular timeline given for them but no indication about what support is going to be available Colette brought attention to the gaps that still exist, particularly self-employed people who have been left out We need to recover from this crisis strongly businesses like the ones we have been hearing from need to be supported so they can keep going, take extra people on, get the economy firing again, secure the recovery That's what we need to see",Assertive Questioning
Are you persuaded at all when you hear the scientists talk about the risk of indoor settings ,Pure Questioning
"the risk of infections ticking up as they did, slowly ",Pure Questioning
Does that not give pause ,Pure Questioning
Why can't your government announce earlier whether things like the business rates holiday will be continued or the furlough will be continued All the support remains,Rhetorical Questioning
"Jeremy, is this something you would like to see, that people have something to say they had the vaccine before they come in Nobody has to go to a restaurant nobody has to get on an aeroplane In many ways it is a luxury but I think it is something very important if we are going to break through on the safety rule I feel that we need more than just the practicalities of life In hospitality, it is about the conviviality of community I think people will appreciate it",Pure Questioning

"I mean, if you ever became chancellor, are you saying you're not going to have budgets in order to do these things? I believe it is the prime minister and the government's decision to weigh up these factors.  I think the support package from the chancellor has been generous to date. I think the thing the government is missing -- and you can understand why, they are managing a significant crisis, they don't understand business decision-making, the timescales of it.  We miss the fact that hospitality missed its golden quarter in the last quarter of the year.",Pure Questioning
"what is Labour's position This is not a simple issue That has been summed up in what Jeremy said there are risks in all different directions around this there are major practicalities There are those ethical issues as well and equality issues to me the most important thing, that is obscured a bit about this debate, is about the speed of vaccination",Pure Questioning
"The question is should there be a vaccine passport to allow businesses to ensure COVID safety when entering indoor venues If we don't see people being vaccinated at speed, then it will be very unfair the young people we just mentioned wouldn't be able to have that We have said, for example, we would have wanted the vaccination to go much more quickly we could have had vaccinated over the half term We did state that We believe there could have been capacity to deliver that There are examples of different facilities that said they could have been involved in that vaccination effort",Pure Questioning
"Do you have a position on that If we don't see people being vaccinated at speed, then it will be very unfair the young people we just mentioned wouldn't be able to have that We have said, for example, we would have wanted the vaccination to go much more quickly we could have had vaccinated over the half term We did state that We believe there could have been capacity to deliver that There are examples of different facilities that said they could have been involved in that vaccination effort",Pure Questioning
"What's your answer to the question we have to be driven by the evidence I don't think a politician saying black and white, yes, no, on this without having that evidence is credible We need to look at this carefully Grant will talk about this the government have announced a review around this subject that's right there is, for example, a system in the future that's introduced it needs to command public support if it is going to come in It needs to be credible",Pure Questioning
"one of the things we're going to have to think about, talking about international travel, is what happens if we are largely vaccinated by the summer, for example, but the places people want to go to are not vaccinated ",Rhetorical Questioning
"can the government explain why they think there were no shortages it has been very difficult to explain why there were no shortages we know there were shortages I know that myself from having talked to health professionals, people who were deeply frustrated, who were actually in some cases quite frightened, to be honest with you, about the working situation They were at that frontline it is deeply disappointing that we don't have the openness about what went wrong it was Jeremy, who said we need to learn from what happened during this crisis we need to learn from what happened during this crisis We need to understand, you know, when there were those problems with supply, how we can make sure that we don't end up in that position again I think that's critically important Let's learn from those at the frontline so we can ensure they have what they need into the future",Pure Questioning
"you would find that ethically unacceptable Yes You can't coerce people to have treatments they don't want Whether it is for public good or not, it is coercion. It's unfair",Assertive Questioning

"what's the view of the CBI on this I asked about 200 businesses about this this week It could just be for vaccination, it should also include testing I think that will take care of some of the timing thing I agree with Jeremy, I don't think it is quite the coercion issue because we are talking about voluntary activities It shouldn't be true for compulsory activities",Pure Questioning
Do you think he was right what he was saying was quoting from NHS providers,Pure Questioning
Was he right Yes the NHS providers said they were always able to get it,Pure Questioning
Why do the government think that summer schools are a good way for students to catch up This is a new announcement about summer schools Do you think it would be a good idea,Pure Questioning
"Do you think it would be a good idea the problem with it is that certainly for disadvantaged students, they are not going to take up the opportunity The EEF did a pilot about 50 percent didn't take up the opportunity school leaders know their cohorts, their communities they are best placed to decide how to do the catchup",Pure Questioning
"You think just leave it up to the schools Yes they should make the decisions They know their community, they know their students",Pure Questioning
"You don't think there was a shortage there was a shortage by definition because there wasn't enough in the place it needed to be all the time This is like stocking supermarkets across the country We're going to need 1 million loaves of bread and we'll spread this to them You need 2 million if there's going to be a million bought what's going on here is people are sitting centrally saying we have enough stock for what the country needs that doesn't mean every hospital has enough supply what we have now is an oversupply of vaccine We have people at the end of the day who are trying to get rid of vaccines with volunteers What we didn't have with PPE, it seems to me, is the necessary oversupply of PPE it is disingenuous to say mathematically that we have enough If you haven't enough in every part of the country, you haven't got enough this might be a maths story rather than anything too much more sinister than that",Assertive Questioning
Do you think they would work at summer school? I think we're all going to be doing catch-up in various stages of education and learning in the next few years We're going to have people arriving in universities who haven't had the right education,Pure Questioning
"Anneliese, summer schools, raised by Steph there, is that something you support We do feel there needs to be a lot of support for children to catch up on average, they've lost -- what? -- over 100 days in schools, many of them The summer school programme, as I understand it, it is going to be covering 1 in 3 children who received free school meals This is a small scheme for those who might be keen on attending in the first place the government has this one wrong they are facing up to the scale of the challenge",Pure Questioning
"are you desperate to get them to summer school No Summer is summer It's our summer they have been put under enough pressure with all the home learning, parents have been put under a lot of pressure, and teachers as well we all deserve that six weeks of fun time My two eldest boys who are year 11 and year 13 have been stuck in that bedroom 6 hours a day, five days a week putting in extra lessons, no, I don't think it is fair The same with my two youngest I don't mind if it's an after-school thing a couple of times a week, maybe, during term time, but not during the summer it is so unfair",Pure Questioning

"when will we learn this is a society with society, not with women We have a new bill coming into The House which we're going to be debating It is about safety on our streets In that will actually be something I worked on when I was sports minister around safeguarding 16, 17 years old making sure they are safe",Pure Questioning

"Realistically, what can people do? Cressida Dick was right to say this is rare in terms of something happening and reassuring this is taken seriously as the statement, today, of course, from the Home Secretary Priti Patel. Our safeguarding minister to Bonnie's point is Victoria Atkins. She is determined to protect women.  there's a bill going through The House at the moment which is focused on domestic violence, making sure women are safe in their homes.

Do you agree My overwhelming feeling listening to the interview with Oprah Winfrey and what's happened since is just a great sadness that this has happened to this family the statement the Palace put out a couple of days later struck exactly the right tone when they said that there had been deeply concerning issues raised they wanted the space and privacy to deal with this as a family,Pure Questioning
"Do you think they should be investigated, as the allegations of bullying against Megan are the institution of the monarchy is important for our country they are people and they are a family and need the privacy to deal with it as a family I don't think we should glide over the serious issues that were raised",Pure Questioning

"Have you been on the receiving end of that kind of behaviour, Sam Yeah, I have I've had -- starting from, you know, whistles when you are walking past If I finished a shift at the pub -- obviously not at the moment -- and I'm walking home at 11 o'clock in the evening and you're walking past a man who has his hood up, you're pretending to be on the phone because you're scared about his crossing the road and doing something My 20 year old daughter is renting privately she's due to go back to campus now she's a bit worried where she's going to be living on campus is right near a wooded area that she has to walk through it shouldn't be an issue She was on the phone to me a couple of weeks ago and she said, ""I'm just a bit worried because to get in and out of the campus you have to go through a wooded area and I don't fancy walking through there at nighttime."" I said, you shouldn't feel like that unfortunately that's the case Even with a lot of campus security, it still plays on her mind",Pure Questioning
Were you surprised by that The extent of it I was surprised by it every woman has the right to feel safe walking around the street of this country any time whatsoever What happened today and the fear that women feel is not the fault of women it is the fault of men who have allowed women to feel this way,Pure Questioning

"Would you be happy to settle for 1 percent Yes I think the money -- I think we all have to share the pain To me a 1 percent pay rise is acceptable pain, if that's the right word, considering the pain that others in society have to suffer I do think that we should accept that accept that for the greater societal good accept that other people apart from NHS staff are also suffering through the pandemic and also deserve something",Pure Questioning
"Mims, this must be music to your ears Absolutely As employment minister, at DWP where we had more people coming to be part of DWP from sectors that we never would have imagined would be applying for universal credit One figure that sticks in my mind of our staff, 27,000 extra hours worked over the Easter Bank Holiday weekend to get people paid and supported the handbrake on the economy of the pandemic coming down on them, a massive shock to the system of course it is NHS, our teachers, who have continued to be on the frontline",Assertive Questioning
"Are you persuaded by the fact that at least his fellow co-workers have had secure jobs and income through the pandemic One of the problems here is the sort of divide and rule they've had it so good they should suffer that's not really good enough My members tell me, and the leaders of the NHS tell me, that 1 percent isn't good enough there is a real risk here When I look at the fact that more than 14 percent of NHS frontline staff want to leave as soon as possible we desperately need to get us through the other side 26 percent are thinking of leaving there's a real issue here how we respect the people who have saved lives and done extraordinary work These are not ordinary jobs When you are watching someone die and you are there because they can't speak to their relatives that is a special place the public think they deserve more than 1 percent most of your colleagues do as well",Pure Questioning
"Ideally, what do you think They gave Dominic Cummings a 40 percent pay rise.",Pure Questioning
What do you think they should get? They should not get what they promised. A 1 percent pay rise is a real terms pay cut. It is an insult and the government must think again.,Pure Questioning
"1 percent, is that enough I don't think it is I think probably NHS staff do deserve better pay increase than that possibly not because of the reasons put forward I find it quite patronising, actually, some of this argument, this idea that the NHS staff especially deserve a pay increase because over the last 12 months they have been doing incredible work saving lives I'm not sure what people think NHS staff do when there isn't a pandemic The reality is the decision on public sector pay should be based on two criteria What sort of level and quality of public services do we want what sort of level of public services can we afford",Pure Questioning
What do you think they should get as a pay rise There was a percentage the government had budgeted for,Pure Questioning
Do you think that's enough that should be the minimum they should be getting,Pure Questioning
"What percent do you think At least the 2.1 percent the government promised the NHS workers We have to pay the review body to look at this, this is a normal part of the process",Pure Questioning
"What do you think they should get At least 2.1 percent I want to agree with what Victor said he absolutely hit the nail on the head here Nurses and other NHS workers, because hospital porters, hospital cleaners, all the rest of them over this past year have sweat blood and tears to look after the rest of us They've gone in there where COVID existed and put their lives on the line to look after the rest of us, keep us safe They literally saved the prime minister's life When the British people stood out on the doorsteps week after week applauding those workers, they meant it when Boris Johnson finished clapping he went inside Number 10 Downing Street and slammed the door in their faces and insulted them with a pay cut It's not me saying a pay cut",Pure Questioning

At your own paper I can't say that I have experienced or seen any racism at my own paper,Pure Questioning

isn't that the crux of the matter ,Rhetorical Questioning
"So to not vaccinate everyone here, vaccinate some people here, all the adults, and then start sending abroad the idea of the vaccine trade war is the most depressing thing I've heard after the last 12 months the best thing that happened last night was the EU and the UK saying, look, let's work together let's work together and let that be part of having global cooperation that's what we need We're only going to beat this virus if everyone works together, that's the approach that we've got to take",Assertive Questioning
"so how much confidence can we have in those negotiations? We've bought far more vaccines than we actually need it seems very dog in the manger-ish not to be sharing it and not to be sending it abroad, the rate limiting factor for our vaccination programme is physical giving of the vaccines day by day. We have far more vaccines than we actually need.",Assertive Questioning
"Adam, is when is that opportunity I think it's absolutely right that no one is safe until everyone is safe We're facing a global pandemic, there's the clue we beat this virus all together or not at all as well as it being the morally right thing and ethically right thing to help others, there's actually a bit of enlightened self-interest here as well if we don't actually work together with our European neighbours but actually more broadly than that, look about the issue of the vaccine in developing countries There's a massive role there and the UK is in a strong position to provide moral leadership",Pure Questioning
"When is that moment I think it's absolutely right that no one is safe until everyone is safe We're facing a global pandemic, there's the clue we beat this virus all together or not at all as well as it being the morally right thing and ethically right thing to help others, there's actually a bit of enlightened self-interest here as well if we don't actually work together with our European neighbours but actually more broadly than that, look about the issue of the vaccine in developing countries There's a massive role there and the UK is in a strong position to provide moral leadership",Pure Questioning
"if we were to follow what Nigel's suggesting, that we should be helping other countries, when could that be I think it's absolutely right that no one is safe until everyone is safe We're facing a global pandemic, there's the clue we beat this virus all together or not at all as well as it being the morally right thing and ethically right thing to help others, there's actually a bit of enlightened self-interest here as well if we don't actually work together with our European neighbours but actually more broadly than that, look about the issue of the vaccine in developing countries There's a massive role there and the UK is in a strong position to provide moral leadership",Pure Questioning
do you think the government is right to suggest that we should vaccinate our entire population before we start thinking about shipping some of our vaccines out to other countries ,Pure Questioning
"would you be prepared to give up your vaccine, say, Camilla, for another country I can't say that as a healthcare worker, I've had mine it is very important that we think altruistically as a global community none of us are going to really feel safe going on holiday until the other countries are safer than they currently are",Pure Questioning
So what does that mean in practice that's why we have a pay review system independent of government that makes these types of recommendation it is really important for retention that that pay review body looks at all the evidence and delivers a real increase to our workers in the NHS who tirelessly worked and been those bridges of compassion to families in this really difficult crisis,Pure Questioning
you don't support the one per cent then ,Pure Questioning
"do you think here in the UK, we should vaccinate our own population first before we start exporting vaccines That is what we're going to do",Pure Questioning
"That is what we're going to do Yes, because we've got contracts and supplies that are coming in we've a real success story here in Wales every UK nation can be proud of its own vaccination programme it's just a matter of fact that we have done even better than other countries We're going faster than elsewhere That's a real matter of pride  and we're going to finish the job with the vaccines we've got But I fully expect that there will be help from the UK to other parts of the world but everyone just needs to calm down because members of the public rolling in and saying it's the Europeans, it's the Brits, well, I just think that's really unhelpful It's about getting supplies to all parts of the world as quickly as possible and I have conversations with Conservative ministers about this people who are my opponents politically but we have grown-up conversations I speak with the vaccine companies themselves as well So it's about how quickly we can all go to make us all safe",Rhetorical Questioning
"one per cent wouldn't be enough, by your definition? I don't believe it would be enough, no that's why I've been making a stronger recommendation to the pay review body I wouldn't be going arbitrarily around with numbers that I know weren't sustainable over the period when I was on a programme with Adam Price recently, he was talking about a 12 per cent pay rise he's now gone to four per cent",Rhetorical Questioning

what did you think when the Prime Minister talked about our response to the pandemic as our apparent success It is not an apparent success Throughout this crisis we quite rightly supported the government in its aim of minimising loss of life We also called out things where we thought the government was not acting as we thought it should There are questions how well prepared the country was for this particular type of pandemic we were also slow in the lockdown slow in terms of a comprehensive test and tracing strategy there have been significant problems between what the government said is available in terms of personal protective equipment and what's actually got to the front line,Pure Questioning

"Why do you think then, if that is true, not according to you, we have so many deaths then it is really difficult to tell at this point I know people quite rightly want the answers there are potentially lots of answers If you look at population density, it is clearly one you raised quite correctly the fact that our social care sector has been completely neglected We know what happens in a crisis, is that the crisis inevitably finds one of weakest links in terms of the area that's been underinvested and that's not been sorted out There are some reasons I am sure All I am saying is we need to be careful about jumping to immediate conclusions on the basis of incomplete evidence at this point",Pure Questioning
"What about earlier than that Listen, what we tried to do throughout this crisis is to be supportive, Fiona You asked when we called for lockdown I was in the House of Commons the day we did The point I am making really is, of course, we will come to a point in the future when we must look very robustly with great scrutiny as to what the government is doing and what differently it could have done throughout this crisis We have to answer that question as to why we have ended up with this tragic death toll as we have at the same time we can't simply say this is something for the future I hope the government is learning lessons as it is going along on the issues of testing and tracing, on the issues of personal protective equipment to try to minimise loss of life going forward",Pure Questioning

"Are they going to get tested These are things we are working through Testing along with this is an option This is why we are piloting it to work out precisely how this would work It could be very powerful because it will show where you get flare ups in particular parts of the country because lots of people will be reporting symptoms We will be able to track and monitor the virus and our success in keeping the infection rates down If there are hot spots that flare up and action is needed we will have that knowledge The crucial thing is it is not going to be storing and recording people's locations that can be identified to an individual This is a system that keeps all of that data anonymous It operates, you know, as a system that keeps people's identity in a clear of any involvement",Pure Questioning
"do you think we should be doing that we are in favour of using track and trace We have been arguing a strategy on this for some considerable time now the app is very much part of that it is an essential tool as we look at that tracing strategy now going forward t is also true to say, though, it is going to require oversight",Pure Questioning

"Is it appropriate to ease the lockdown differently in different areas the first point is as Chris said, it is better if we can try and have a single approach because otherwise it does get confusing concerning some of the advice from the chief medical officer I know the prevalence can be quite different in different parts of the county the so-called R rate, the reproductive rate, is quite similar across the country The argument for having very different measures is probably not very strong There are parts of the country that have a lot of tourism There are issues about how we exit lockdown which sectors of the economy you try to tentatively open and at which stage These are factors obviously that will be taken into account in that context",Pure Questioning

how can you convince people like that that this does matter This anomaly has only just appeared there's clearly time for the story to run It should matter The election commission which is a financial regulator sees the evidence they think there are reasonable grounds to investigate this That is a very serious matter the public are reserving judgment to see what comes out People should worry Downing Street could have come clean at the start of this week They have refused to do so We know the Prime Minister has appointed a so-called independent investigator he Prime Minister himself can veto the publication of that investigator's report He is hardly independent at all this is a real scandal the real scandal of this story is that hundreds of thousands of leaseholders this week will be left without any financial protection for remediating fire safety defects and cladding on their flats whilst the Prime Minister and his team are concerned about papering-over a story about how he has refurbished his flat,Pure Questioning

This is a fund you were keen to bring up The impact of the bill going through for people like Natalie and the hundreds of thousands of leaseholdsers is devastating I was on the committee last summer I joined the committee that was scrutinising this piece of legislation I introduced the principle that leaseholders should not have to pay for fire safety defects that are not of their making Liberal Democrats have stood with leaseholders from the very start to the very end last night we were the ones who pushed the amendment again,Assertive Questioning
"Who do you think should be paying that bill I introduced the principle ten months ago For ten months, the Government has refused to come up with a system to sort this out It's on the Government for not coming forward with the system I support what the cladding action group is calling for which is the Government should stump up the money in the first instance to remediate and make these homes safe they are fire traps They are death traps It is outrageous that almost four years on from the Grenfell tragedy we think it's OK for people to live in these kind of places",Pure Questioning

"With Covid cases and deaths in India continuing to increase, is the British Government doing enough to support India No. I don't think the UK Government is doing enough to support India the UK Government has sent medical supplies we absolutely vitally need the Government to do is to send vaccines back in February, the Liberal Democrats wrote to the Government said after the first four million most vulnerable people in the UK have been vaccinated, we think that the Government should embark on a parallel roll-out of the vaccine through the UK and through Kofax which is the international vaccine scheme",Pure Questioning
"When you say the first four million do you mean to the age of 50 The first four million which was the first four or five cohorts We are way beyond that now The situation we have is that none of us are safe until all of us are safe For as long as people in India cannot get the vaccine, not only will loads of people die but it also means that the virus will mutate again and that will turn up into other strains that will wash-up on our shores It is both the morally right thing to do, and also a self-interested thing to do to make sure that we get this parallel roll-out Norway is doing it the US is sending vaccines at the moment the UK Government has not yet committed to sending vaccines to India",Pure Questioning

"Can you see the Government doing that Yes now merged int Foreign and Commonwealth development office I worked with G AR VI the vaccine alliance We raised 8. 8 billion dollars for them last year over a billion more than was our target they would then also be able to help get going on a vaccine programme to help developing countries if and when a vaccine which at the time seemed like a very long way off, something that was possible we then worked with the WHO to set up Kofax  we could find a way to harness exactly as everyone is saying, the ability for G AR VI to be able to deliver into those countries vaccines as and if, it felt like it, there was a vaccine coming",Pure Questioning
is there any changing your minds? The discussions are ongoing with the WTO I'm not party to the detail the important thing is getting those vaccines made,Pure Questioning
what is your view? We knew this would be a challenge is the ability to produce the vaccine in the quantities that are needed India's population over a billion and so on there's a need for the quantum Bill Gates made a move last summer said I'm going to create vaccine production facilities I'm going to create vaccine production facilities I don't know if there's a vaccine that we could use there could be a vaccine India has been the heart of other vaccines for many countries for lots of years,Pure Questioning

You think the property rights should be loosened We need an international agreement on that urgently We need an international agreement on investing in the manufacturing capability in parts of the world so they can start doing their own vaccine manufacturing and India can manufacture but there's many parts of the world that can't We need an international agreement around genomic sequences,Assertive Questioning

"What should happen now Before Christmas I co-ordinated a group of 40 MPs on a cross-party basis to ask the Government to change two or three things First of all what carers were asking for why was it OK for paid carers to be going in but not for family carers to be going in and out we asked for family members to be designated as the specific carer and to get access to the same level of testing that the paid carers were getting what is really important in cases where you have mentioned people who have dementia for example, their decline has been so rapid without that family contact this is about the balance of harms we do need to see measures in place to allow carers to see people otherwise they are going to die of neglect rather than dying of Covid It is unbearable for those people and for their carers We need to see that acceleration care homes themselves are asking for protection like the hospitals have, like the NHS has",Pure Questioning

"In terms of the question, should that mean Keir Starmer should go? No there are two reasons why it is not such a great surprise The first is that we've had a suspension of normal politics for the 13 months of Keir Starmer's leadership and, indeed, a few days before In December 2019 people said they wanted to get Brexit done, and the government has delivered on the first phase of Brexit I happen to think it is the most colossal foreign Policy blunder in the post-war period but people voted for it In a sense it would be counterintuitive if voters said we know we wanted that in significant numbers even in Hartlepool where Brexit party is not standing this time but actually we're going to punish the government that delivered what we said we wanted them to deliver I think you have to allow for the fact, consistent with the fact of suspension of normal politics, there is a wave of relief in the country at the arrival and, yes, the effective distribution of the vaccine  and a desire to reward the government Now the distribution is overwhelmingly about the NHS and the devising of the vaccine is overwhelmingly about the quality of scientists and little to do with the government Nevertheless, it has been a success In light of the two factors there should be such a turn of opinion in a short period",Pure Questioning
