What can the panel suggest for a whole generation of school children who are now missing nearly half an academic year and face months of distrust about social distancing and social contact and the face of further disruption There's obviously some schools are going to go back on 1st June Some are not What's happening where you are,Pure Questioning
What's happening where you are It is a mixed picture some are going back Some have said they would rather take their time to get the right arrangements in place we want to get the kids back in school if we can as quickly as possible it's got to be done as safely as possible The key thing is here schools haven't closed It is not as if they have not been doing anything over recent weeks Of course they have been looking after children of key workers teachers are feeling a bit stressed from the teacher-bashing they have seen this week we need to sort of de-escalate this row a little bit,Pure Questioning
Do you think it would be more likely to be successful if head teachers had known about 1 June before it was announced to the nation at large when they heard it on television? There are thousands of head teachers and tens of hundreds of thousands of teachers it is hard to announce it to tens of thousands of people,Pure Questioning
Why not? ,Rhetorical Questioning
"You don't have some of the fears we have heard from teachers and some of the unions No I have been impressed by schools how they are going to social distance the children We have had a massive dossier for the eldest, washing hands, having temperature checks at the door and how they are going to be separated in class",Pure Questioning
"why was a decision taken then it is very hard to compare the UK with Denmark Denmark is a much smaller country We have a different political system based on much more compromise, consultation we could never send children back to school without deep consultation with teachers' unions, head teachers and also parents they did succeed in sending people back",Pure Questioning

You are saying the only way to tell schools was to do it through a press conference you make an announcement to tens of thousands of head teachers you have made it publically The Unions have been closely consulted about the science They have been on calls where scientific advisers have briefed them on that I would urge teaching unions and their members to positively and constructively engage with schools to find safe ways of going back,Pure Questioning
"Are you confident that it will be the test, track and trace will be fully embedded by June 1st I am a computer science student My experience of software engineering is things do go wrong They go often wrong and we are running out of time If you want to launch an app on the same day that schools open, you are asking for the worst",Pure Questioning

Do you have any concerns about that from the perspective of all of the evidence pointing to children not being badly affected if they do catch it and not seemingly being as infectious as adults considering all of the measures that schools have been put in place to make sure that children are safe considering the fact that they are missing out on so much of their education by being at home all of this is about assessing risk and weighing up the different probabilities on a balance of probabilities overall after now two months at home with us trying to home educate them as well as we can while also working I think that on balance my children are better off in school,Pure Questioning
Do you think the government should help by bailing us out as the country starts to get back on its feet certain industries and certain companies are going to have to -- they can contribute as profitable industries can contribute substantially to the revitalising and the reopening of Britain It is incumbent upon us to sometimes have these difficult conversations with government we need to tell them the specific challenges that we are going to have in order to play that active role in reactivating the economy,Pure Questioning
What are parents supposed to make of that they are probably a bit confused by it all It is a row that has been going on I am not sure that helps parents I would agree with Helle Let head teachers sit in the driving seat and decide when it is safe to open school Parents will probably look most to head teachers for advice about safety of their kids it should also be done in consultation with local councils the circumstances will differ from one place to another in terms of the teaching staff Some of them may be self-isolating There may be issues they have to deal with when we look at the staff There will be physical circumstances at the school,Pure Questioning

"What is the consequence for children who can't go to school. We will have children -- I mean for practically lose a whole year of education. Â  They have simply can't remember what they learned six months ago. So I am a little bit worried that if you last too long, we will be taking a little bit of the chirp's future twice.  First we will take almost a year of their education an then we are also handing them a very, very large bill for a lockdown which has become very, very expensive. So there is these balances to find but I would just again say find a good balance with also the teachers and take the heat out of it.  but I would just again say find a good balance with also the teachers and take the heat out of it. The only way this can be solved is by being pragmatic",Pure Questioning
"Claire, what do you think of what you have heard? I quite like Helle's idea of using venues creative leave.  I think what I fear is that the value of education will have been taken away from children and I think this is every child.  It is children from reception right up to the 6 formers that have lost out on their 'A' levels and are actually grieveing because of that but also I think what I fear is that there will be a distrust about social contract",Pure Questioning

Having the app is not critical to contact tracing Experience in the Isle of Wight shows you can do effective contatracing without the app the app is helpful it adds something to it and we will get that in a few weeks' time There are all sorts of other innovations happening Matt Hancock talked about a test being deployed today that gives you a result in 20 minutes We have had advances in antibody testing today as well the science is really beginning to catch up with this disease For me the science is really what gives me hope for the future hope we can move beyond the strange circumstances of the last few weeks and return to something of a normal life as the months go by,Pure Questioning
"when can we expect to see the full implementation of test track and trace Full implemenation, according to the government anyway, is critical in terms of easing the lockdown and getting children back to school when are we going to see test, track and trace fully amounted, not just the kind of the beginnings of it, but fully implemented We have seen the new app being tested in the Isle of Wight We have learned from that experience One of the things we have learned is we can effectively deploy test, track and trace with the manual tracers We have recruited 24000 of those already We will be up to the full complement of 25,000 by 1st June the service will be fully operational on 1st June, able to track and trace 10,00from 1st June onwards The app we think will be ready to deploy a few weeks after that the two are complementary the system will work comprehensively from 1st June which is one of the government's critical test You will help us learn more about the way this disease spreads It will help us stop it spreading any further",Pure Questioning

"can you see the government extending a helping hand In terms of what we have done already I would strongly encourage every arts organisation to use all of the existing schemes James mentioned the for other scheme already Every organisation in the position, for example, of theatre should be using that scheme to have their staff who can't work paid at 80% of their Sarl each Government is funding that and has recently extended it There are significant loan schemes available under the government backed loan schemes that have paid out now over Â£20 billion there is no question the government has made a massive outlay when it comes to support small business There are a lot of people employed in the theatre who can't access the for owe scheme and lot of theatres are saying the loans don't apply to them which is why they are asking for the money Is there anything additional the government can do",Pure Questioning

Does the Panel feel this has been undermined in any way by the events of this last week It feels like we have done nothing else but talk about the events of the last week and of course Dominic Cummings,Pure Questioning

How could he possibly say to his constituents they were wrong and Dominic Cummings was right",Assertive Questioning
"do you feel compliance may have been undermined by the events of the last few days The question is really about what is the impact of that and what we have heard from our members who are CEOs of hospitals, GPs, all across the health system People are worried that public health messages are being undermined They are already hearing that people are making decisions they might not have otherwise made That's really worrying in order for these public measures, whether lockdown, test, track and trace, any of these things to work, we need to have a really clear message that's not open to too much interpretation and discretion we need to have this public feeling that we are all in it together",Pure Questioning
"Are you worried people may now -- the comment from Keith, ""move on and I don't want to talk about it anymore"" What we have seen so far is people really consciously following guidance the guidance has included recognising that some situations will be more difficult For instance, if you are looking after somebody who is particularly vulnerable, have a childcare situation",Pure Questioning
"what I am asking is whether or not you feel it would make any difference in terms of compliance generally yes, it will like Alison said, there is people with integrity out there and people who do the right thing for society and their family there is people with integrity out there and people who do the right thing for society and their family there is other people like Dominic Cummings looks for the loophole and looks for the cheap way You are cheating society by doing this Ultimately you are putting lives at risk Behaviour breeds behaviour especially with someone so influential",Pure Questioning
"Has it had any impact on whether you will be more or less confined as we go into test and protect or test and isolate now no, from a personal level I would follow the guidelines I've got enough integrity to do that it will have an impact on some people who are just fed up with the whole idea that someone can get away with something when the rest are not supposed to",Pure Questioning

"When you don't know all the people you have been closer than 2-metre contact with, without the app how are you going to find them you will find a Â lot of people will know people they have spent close contact with for a sustained period of time That's what you would talk through with the tracers So they can contact them This is a known way of dealing with a pandemic and controlling it So we are not making this up This is a system that is known to work",Pure Questioning
"Is that what your constituents were saying to you when it when it first broke, this story I have received e-mails from constituents every MP has constituents who have talked about some of the sacrifices they have made and things they have missed out on I don't think we should suggest for a moment that lockdown is anything other than very hard what's really important is that we now have the infection rate under control and falling we are in a position to ease some of the lockdown measures launching NHS test and trace referred to by Alison that is so important to continuing to keep it under control we can get life going again",Pure Questioning

"What if people don't put themselves forward The reason we have been successful in reducing the prevalence of Coronavirus is because of massive volumes of public participation and compliance The same applies to the track, trace, self-isolate and support strategy, test and protect that we are putting out in Scotland It relies on people coming forward where they have symptoms, indicating they have those symptoms and then for us pursuing the contact There will be privacy applied, essentially the source of the virus that has been drawn to attention of other individuals, but it fundamentally relies on public participation, public trust and public confidence we need to have that similar level of communication and consent from members of the public in wrestling with the contact tracing strategy",Assertive Questioning

"Do you think that this pandemic has been managed better by Nicola Sturgeon in Scotland than it has by Boris Johnson in England Well, I donât think it is a competition because every government is responsible with the trust of the people to manage this pandemic in a way that sees the virus suppressed and also trying to manage the other harms, whether those are economic, social or other health harms Weâve seen from some of the polling, certainly even this week, that, I think, about three-quarters of people in Scotland are satisfied with the way that Nicola Sturgeon has handled the pandemic",Pure Questioning

"Mark, do you want to kick us off with this? Yes, sure. The first thing to say is that this virus transmits in indoor spaces more easily than it does in the outside.Â  The second thing is that, going back to the last question, the numbers arenât going down because weâre on average making too many social contacts So we know that lockdown works because when this pandemic started with tight restrictions it did come under control. Restaurants, cafÃ©s, it depends, actually, how people are seated. It depends how people behave, whether they are inside or outside. when you read through, and I read through before coming, all the different restrictions, I looked at Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, it is very confusing, and it is different. The bottom line is we need to reduce our social contacts and until we get it down similar to the levels we started with, this is not going to come under control. Frankly, we do need to get on top of the second wave and urgency does matter. we just have to get on with it and I donât think it is helpful having lots of different hard-to-understand rules.",Pure Questioning

Is the government doing enough to help assist the fishing and shellfish industries The answer to that is no They made some 100 million pounds available the fact is that there is quite a lot to be sorted out in terms of the application of idiotic rules both across the straits into Europe and also within our own country in Northern Ireland,Pure Questioning

"What's your feeling about this The social contact is no different As much as I believe the British public want to do the right thing, the reality is, as an operator, I'll manage that for you I'll make sure you're safe that's what we do, we're experts in safety If the guidelines are there to make sure people are 1.5, 2 metres apart, I'll do that for you To make people manage that themselves, it is difficult",Pure Questioning
"do you agree with Jeremy and with James that it is going too slowly for the hospitality business There are sectors of the economy who are unhappy with the plan I think the real regret is that you have to wait 10 days for the budget The budget is part 2 of this plan It is really important that if we're going to keep those sectors closed, for reasons I completely understand",Pure Questioning
"Do you think it is right to keep them closed so long as the government is suggesting I think the prime minister is the one person in the country who has to weigh up medical advice, school requirements, different sectors of the economy I think it is only right if financial support comes along but only 40 percent of pubs have outdoor space I spoke to a pub landlord in Cornwall today saying there's no way I could afford to open my pub so the outdoor is almost irrelevant",Pure Questioning

"Jeremy, is this something you would like to see, that people have something to say they had the vaccine before they come in Nobody has to go to a restaurant nobody has to get on an aeroplane In many ways it is a luxury but I think it is something very important if we are going to break through on the safety rule I feel that we need more than just the practicalities of life In hospitality, it is about the conviviality of community I think people will appreciate it",Pure Questioning

I believe it is the prime minister and the government's decision to weigh up these factors.  I think the support package from the chancellor has been generous to date. I think the thing the government is missing -- and you can understand why, they are managing a significant crisis, they don't understand business decision-making, the timescales of it.  We miss the fact that hospitality missed its golden quarter in the last quarter of the year.",Pure Questioning
"what is Labour's position This is not a simple issue That has been summed up in what Jeremy said there are risks in all different directions around this there are major practicalities There are those ethical issues as well and equality issues to me the most important thing, that is obscured a bit about this debate, is about the speed of vaccination",Pure Questioning
"The question is should there be a vaccine passport to allow businesses to ensure COVID safety when entering indoor venues If we don't see people being vaccinated at speed, then it will be very unfair the young people we just mentioned wouldn't be able to have that We have said, for example, we would have wanted the vaccination to go much more quickly we could have had vaccinated over the half term We did state that We believe there could have been capacity to deliver that There are examples of different facilities that said they could have been involved in that vaccination effort",Pure Questioning

"can the government explain why they think there were no shortages it has been very difficult to explain why there were no shortages we know there were shortages I know that myself from having talked to health professionals, people who were deeply frustrated, who were actually in some cases quite frightened, to be honest with you, about the working situation They were at that frontline it is deeply disappointing that we don't have the openness about what went wrong it was Jeremy, who said we need to learn from what happened during this crisis we need to learn from what happened during this crisis We need to understand, you know, when there were those problems with supply, how we can make sure that we don't end up in that position again I think that's critically important Let's learn from those at the frontline so we can ensure they have what they need into the future",Pure Questioning

Why do the government think that summer schools are a good way for students to catch up This is a new announcement about summer schools Do you think it would be a good idea,Pure Questioning
"Do you think it would be a good idea the problem with it is that certainly for disadvantaged students, they are not going to take up the opportunity The EEF did a pilot about 50 percent didn't take up the opportunity school leaders know their cohorts, their communities they are best placed to decide how to do the catchup",Pure Questioning
"You think just leave it up to the schools Yes they should make the decisions They know their community, they know their students",Pure Questioning
"You don't think there was a shortage there was a shortage by definition because there wasn't enough in the place it needed to be all the time This is like stocking supermarkets across the country We're going to need 1 million loaves of bread and we'll spread this to them You need 2 million if there's going to be a million bought what's going on here is people are sitting centrally saying we have enough stock for what the country needs that doesn't mean every hospital has enough supply what we have now is an oversupply of vaccine We have people at the end of the day who are trying to get rid of vaccines with volunteers What we didn't have with PPE, it seems to me, is the necessary oversupply of PPE it is disingenuous to say mathematically that we have enough If you haven't enough in every part of the country, you haven't got enough this might be a maths story rather than anything too much more sinister than that",Assertive Questioning
Do you think they would work at summer school? I think we're all going to be doing catch-up in various stages of education and learning in the next few years We're going to have people arriving in universities who haven't had the right education,Pure Questioning

"are you desperate to get them to summer school No Summer is summer It's our summer they have been put under enough pressure with all the home learning, parents have been put under a lot of pressure, and teachers as well we all deserve that six weeks of fun time My two eldest boys who are year 11 and year 13 have been stuck in that bedroom 6 hours a day, five days a week putting in extra lessons, no, I don't think it is fair The same with my two youngest I don't mind if it's an after-school thing a couple of times a week, maybe, during term time, but not during the summer it is so unfair",Pure Questioning

Cressida Dick was right to say this is rare in terms of something happening and reassuring this is taken seriously as the statement, today, of course, from the Home Secretary Priti Patel.

I said, you shouldn't feel like that unfortunately that's the case Even with a lot of campus security, it still plays on her mind",Pure Questioning

"Mims, this must be music to your ears Absolutely As employment minister, at DWP where we had more people coming to be part of DWP from sectors that we never would have imagined would be applying for universal credit One figure that sticks in my mind of our staff, 27,000 extra hours worked over the Easter Bank Holiday weekend to get people paid and supported the handbrake on the economy of the pandemic coming down on them, a massive shock to the system of course it is NHS, our teachers, who have continued to be on the frontline",Assertive Questioning
"Are you persuaded by the fact that at least his fellow co-workers have had secure jobs and income through the pandemic One of the problems here is the sort of divide and rule they've had it so good they should suffer that's not really good enough My members tell me, and the leaders of the NHS tell me, that 1 percent isn't good enough there is a real risk here When I look at the fact that more than 14 percent of NHS frontline staff want to leave as soon as possible we desperately need to get us through the other side 26 percent are thinking of leaving there's a real issue here how we respect the people who have saved lives and done extraordinary work These are not ordinary jobs When you are watching someone die and you are there because they can't speak to their relatives that is a special place the public think they deserve more than 1 percent most of your colleagues do as well",Pure Questioning
"Ideally, what do you think They gave Dominic Cummings a 40 percent pay rise.",Pure Questioning
What do you think they should get? They should not get what they promised. A 1 percent pay rise is a real terms pay cut. It is an insult and the government must think again.,Pure Questioning
"1 percent, is that enough I don't think it is I think probably NHS staff do deserve better pay increase than that possibly not because of the reasons put forward I find it quite patronising, actually, some of this argument, this idea that the NHS staff especially deserve a pay increase because over the last 12 months they have been doing incredible work saving lives I'm not sure what people think NHS staff do when there isn't a pandemic The reality is the decision on public sector pay should be based on two criteria What sort of level and quality of public services do we want what sort of level of public services can we afford",Pure Questioning
What do you think they should get as a pay rise There was a percentage the government had budgeted for,Pure Questioning

"What do you think they should get At least 2.1 percent I want to agree with what Victor said he absolutely hit the nail on the head here Nurses and other NHS workers, because hospital porters, hospital cleaners, all the rest of them over this past year have sweat blood and tears to look after the rest of us They've gone in there where COVID existed and put their lives on the line to look after the rest of us, keep us safe They literally saved the prime minister's life When the British people stood out on the doorsteps week after week applauding those workers, they meant it when Boris Johnson finished clapping he went inside Number 10 Downing Street and slammed the door in their faces and insulted them with a pay cut It's not me saying a pay cut",Pure Questioning

"So to not vaccinate everyone here, vaccinate some people here, all the adults, and then start sending abroad the idea of the vaccine trade war is the most depressing thing I've heard after the last 12 months the best thing that happened last night was the EU and the UK saying, look, let's work together let's work together and let that be part of having global cooperation that's what we need We're only going to beat this virus if everyone works together, that's the approach that we've got to take",Assertive Questioning
"so how much confidence can we have in those negotiations? We've bought far more vaccines than we actually need it seems very dog in the manger-ish not to be sharing it and not to be sending it abroad, the rate limiting factor for our vaccination programme is physical giving of the vaccines day by day. We have far more vaccines than we actually need.",Assertive Questioning
"Adam, is when is that opportunity I think it's absolutely right that no one is safe until everyone is safe We're facing a global pandemic, there's the clue we beat this virus all together or not at all as well as it being the morally right thing and ethically right thing to help others, there's actually a bit of enlightened self-interest here as well if we don't actually work together with our European neighbours but actually more broadly than that, look about the issue of the vaccine in developing countries There's a massive role there and the UK is in a strong position to provide moral leadership",Pure Questioning
"When is that moment I think it's absolutely right that no one is safe until everyone is safe We're facing a global pandemic, there's the clue we beat this virus all together or not at all as well as it being the morally right thing and ethically right thing to help others, there's actually a bit of enlightened self-interest here as well if we don't actually work together with our European neighbours but actually more broadly than that, look about the issue of the vaccine in developing countries There's a massive role there and the UK is in a strong position to provide moral leadership",Pure Questioning
"if we were to follow what Nigel's suggesting, that we should be helping other countries, when could that be I think it's absolutely right that no one is safe until everyone is safe We're facing a global pandemic, there's the clue we beat this virus all together or not at all as well as it being the morally right thing and ethically right thing to help others, there's actually a bit of enlightened self-interest here as well if we don't actually work together with our European neighbours but actually more broadly than that, look about the issue of the vaccine in developing countries There's a massive role there and the UK is in a strong position to provide moral leadership",Pure Questioning
do you think the government is right to suggest that we should vaccinate our entire population before we start thinking about shipping some of our vaccines out to other countries ,Pure Questioning
"would you be prepared to give up your vaccine, say, Camilla, for another country I can't say that as a healthcare worker, I've had mine it is very important that we think altruistically as a global community none of us are going to really feel safe going on holiday until the other countries are safer than they currently are",Pure Questioning
So what does that mean in practice that's why we have a pay review system independent of government that makes these types of recommendation it is really important for retention that that pay review body looks at all the evidence and delivers a real increase to our workers in the NHS who tirelessly worked and been those bridges of compassion to families in this really difficult crisis,Pure Questioning
you don't support the one per cent then ,Pure Questioning
"do you think here in the UK, we should vaccinate our own population first before we start exporting vaccines That is what we're going to do",Pure Questioning
"That is what we're going to do Yes, because we've got contracts and supplies that are coming in we've a real success story here in Wales every UK nation can be proud of its own vaccination programme it's just a matter of fact that we have done even better than other countries We're going faster than elsewhere That's a real matter of pride  and we're going to finish the job with the vaccines we've got But I fully expect that there will be help from the UK to other parts of the world but everyone just needs to calm down because members of the public rolling in and saying it's the Europeans, it's the Brits, well, I just think that's really unhelpful It's about getting supplies to all parts of the world as quickly as possible and I have conversations with Conservative ministers about this people who are my opponents politically but we have grown-up conversations I speak with the vaccine companies themselves as well So it's about how quickly we can all go to make us all safe",Rhetorical Questioning
"one per cent wouldn't be enough, by your definition? I don't believe it would be enough, no that's why I've been making a stronger recommendation to the pay review body I wouldn't be going arbitrarily around with numbers that I know weren't sustainable over the period when I was on a programme with Adam Price recently, he was talking about a 12 per cent pay rise he's now gone to four per cent",Rhetorical Questioning
"What, supporting the unions is jumping on a bandwagon there's an awful lot of workers in Wales who don't work in the NHS an awful lot of them wouldn't want a pay rise An awful lot of them would want to have some pay and some guaranteed employment",Rhetorical Questioning

what did you think when the Prime Minister talked about our response to the pandemic as our apparent success It is not an apparent success Throughout this crisis we quite rightly supported the government in its aim of minimising loss of life We also called out things where we thought the government was not acting as we thought it should There are questions how well prepared the country was for this particular type of pandemic we were also slow in the lockdown slow in terms of a comprehensive test and tracing strategy there have been significant problems between what the government said is available in terms of personal protective equipment and what's actually got to the front line,Pure Questioning

"Why do you think then, if that is true, not according to you, we have so many deaths then it is really difficult to tell at this point I know people quite rightly want the answers there are potentially lots of answers If you look at population density, it is clearly one you raised quite correctly the fact that our social care sector has been completely neglected We know what happens in a crisis, is that the crisis inevitably finds one of weakest links in terms of the area that's been underinvested and that's not been sorted out There are some reasons I am sure All I am saying is we need to be careful about jumping to immediate conclusions on the basis of incomplete evidence at this point",Pure Questioning
"What about earlier than that Listen, what we tried to do throughout this crisis is to be supportive, Fiona You asked when we called for lockdown I was in the House of Commons the day we did The point I am making really is, of course, we will come to a point in the future when we must look very robustly with great scrutiny as to what the government is doing and what differently it could have done throughout this crisis We have to answer that question as to why we have ended up with this tragic death toll as we have at the same time we can't simply say this is something for the future I hope the government is learning lessons as it is going along on the issues of testing and tracing, on the issues of personal protective equipment to try to minimise loss of life going forward",Pure Questioning

"Is it appropriate to ease the lockdown differently in different areas the first point is as Chris said, it is better if we can try and have a single approach because otherwise it does get confusing concerning some of the advice from the chief medical officer I know the prevalence can be quite different in different parts of the county the so-called R rate, the reproductive rate, is quite similar across the country The argument for having very different measures is probably not very strong There are parts of the country that have a lot of tourism There are issues about how we exit lockdown which sectors of the economy you try to tentatively open and at which stage These are factors obviously that will be taken into account in that context",Pure Questioning

This is a fund you were keen to bring up The impact of the bill going through for people like Natalie and the hundreds of thousands of leaseholdsers is devastating I was on the committee last summer I joined the committee that was scrutinising this piece of legislation I introduced the principle that leaseholders should not have to pay for fire safety defects that are not of their making Liberal Democrats have stood with leaseholders from the very start to the very end last night we were the ones who pushed the amendment again,Assertive Questioning
"Who do you think should be paying that bill I introduced the principle ten months ago For ten months, the Government has refused to come up with a system to sort this out It's on the Government for not coming forward with the system I support what the cladding action group is calling for which is the Government should stump up the money in the first instance to remediate and make these homes safe they are fire traps They are death traps It is outrageous that almost four years on from the Grenfell tragedy we think it's OK for people to live in these kind of places",Pure Questioning

"With Covid cases and deaths in India continuing to increase, is the British Government doing enough to support India No. I don't think the UK Government is doing enough to support India the UK Government has sent medical supplies we absolutely vitally need the Government to do is to send vaccines back in February, the Liberal Democrats wrote to the Government said after the first four million most vulnerable people in the UK have been vaccinated, we think that the Government should embark on a parallel roll-out of the vaccine through the UK and through Kofax which is the international vaccine scheme",Pure Questioning
"When you say the first four million do you mean to the age of 50 The first four million which was the first four or five cohorts We are way beyond that now The situation we have is that none of us are safe until all of us are safe For as long as people in India cannot get the vaccine, not only will loads of people die but it also means that the virus will mutate again and that will turn up into other strains that will wash-up on our shores It is both the morally right thing to do, and also a self-interested thing to do to make sure that we get this parallel roll-out Norway is doing it the US is sending vaccines at the moment the UK Government has not yet committed to sending vaccines to India",Pure Questioning

"Can you see the Government doing that Yes now merged int Foreign and Commonwealth development office I worked with G AR VI the vaccine alliance We raised 8. 8 billion dollars for them last year over a billion more than was our target they would then also be able to help get going on a vaccine programme to help developing countries if and when a vaccine which at the time seemed like a very long way off, something that was possible we then worked with the WHO to set up Kofax  we could find a way to harness exactly as everyone is saying, the ability for G AR VI to be able to deliver into those countries vaccines as and if, it felt like it, there was a vaccine coming",Pure Questioning
is there any changing your minds? The discussions are ongoing with the WTO I'm not party to the detail the important thing is getting those vaccines made,Pure Questioning
what is your view? We knew this would be a challenge is the ability to produce the vaccine in the quantities that are needed India's population over a billion and so on there's a need for the quantum Bill Gates made a move last summer said I'm going to create vaccine production facilities I'm going to create vaccine production facilities I don't know if there's a vaccine that we could use there could be a vaccine India has been the heart of other vaccines for many countries for lots of years,Pure Questioning

What is it What we desperately need is an international agreement about shared intellecture property rights on vaccination What we need is investment in vaccination manufacturing capacity,Pure Questioning
You think the property rights should be loosened We need an international agreement on that urgently We need an international agreement on investing in the manufacturing capability in parts of the world so they can start doing their own vaccine manufacturing and India can manufacture but there's many parts of the world that can't We need an international agreement around genomic sequences,Assertive Questioning

"What should happen now Before Christmas I co-ordinated a group of 40 MPs on a cross-party basis to ask the Government to change two or three things First of all what carers were asking for why was it OK for paid carers to be going in but not for family carers to be going in and out we asked for family members to be designated as the specific carer and to get access to the same level of testing that the paid carers were getting what is really important in cases where you have mentioned people who have dementia for example, their decline has been so rapid without that family contact this is about the balance of harms we do need to see measures in place to allow carers to see people otherwise they are going to die of neglect rather than dying of Covid It is unbearable for those people and for their carers We need to see that acceleration care homes themselves are asking for protection like the hospitals have, like the NHS has",Pure Questioning

"In terms of the question, should that mean Keir Starmer should go? No there are two reasons why it is not such a great surprise The first is that we've had a suspension of normal politics for the 13 months of Keir Starmer's leadership and, indeed, a few days before In December 2019 people said they wanted to get Brexit done, and the government has delivered on the first phase of Brexit I happen to think it is the most colossal foreign Policy blunder in the post-war period but people voted for it In a sense it would be counterintuitive if voters said we know we wanted that in significant numbers even in Hartlepool where Brexit party is not standing this time but actually we're going to punish the government that delivered what we said we wanted them to deliver I think you have to allow for the fact, consistent with the fact of suspension of normal politics, there is a wave of relief in the country at the arrival and, yes, the effective distribution of the vaccine  and a desire to reward the government Now the distribution is overwhelmingly about the NHS and the devising of the vaccine is overwhelmingly about the quality of scientists and little to do with the government Nevertheless, it has been a success In light of the two factors there should be such a turn of opinion in a short period",Pure Questioning
