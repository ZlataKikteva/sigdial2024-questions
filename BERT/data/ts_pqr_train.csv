"Even if some children do get back to school before the end of the summer term, their experience is more likely to be about social distancing and hygiene rather than anything of any educational value What can the panel suggest for a whole generation of school children who are now missing nearly half an academic year and face months of distrust about social distancing and social contact and the face of further disruption There's obviously some schools are going to go back on 1st June Some are not What's happening where you are",Pure Questioning
Some are not What's happening where you are It is a mixed picture some are going back Some have said they would rather take their time to get the right arrangements in place we want to get the kids back in school if we can as quickly as possible it's got to be done as safely as possible The key thing is here schools haven't closed It is not as if they have not been doing anything over recent weeks Of course they have been looking after children of key workers teachers are feeling a bit stressed from the teacher-bashing they have seen this week we need to sort of de-escalate this row a little bit,Pure Questioning
Let's all work together to make that Do you think it would be more likely to be successful if head teachers had known about 1 June before it was announced to the nation at large when they heard it on television? There are thousands of head teachers and tens of hundreds of thousands of teachers it is hard to announce it to tens of thousands of people,Pure Questioning
Do you think we could be doing that kind of thing here Why not? ,Rhetorical Questioning
"I had been asked if all of the children should go back, I would have said yes You don't have some of the fears we have heard from teachers and some of the unions No I have been impressed by schools how they are going to social distance the children We have had a massive dossier for the eldest, washing hands, having temperature checks at the door and how they are going to be separated in class",Pure Questioning
"Yes why was a decision taken then it is very hard to compare the UK with Denmark Denmark is a much smaller country We have a different political system based on much more compromise, consultation we could never send children back to school without deep consultation with teachers' unions, head teachers and also parents they did succeed in sending people back",Pure Questioning
"why was a decision taken then how has it worked it is very hard to compare the UK with Denmark Denmark is a much smaller country We have a different political system based on much more compromise, consultation we could never send children back to school without deep consultation with teachers' unions, head teachers and also parents they did succeed in sending people back",Pure Questioning
That's exactly what they can do You are saying the only way to tell schools was to do it through a press conference you make an announcement to tens of thousands of head teachers you have made it publically The Unions have been closely consulted about the science They have been on calls where scientific advisers have briefed them on that I would urge teaching unions and their members to positively and constructively engage with schools to find safe ways of going back,Pure Questioning
"Alfie, this was your question Are you confident that it will be the test, track and trace will be fully embedded by June 1st I am a computer science student My experience of software engineering is things do go wrong They go often wrong and we are running out of time If you want to launch an app on the same day that schools open, you are asking for the worst",Pure Questioning
"Are you confident that it will be the test, track and trace will be fully embedded by June 1st What prompted your question in the first place I am a computer science student My experience of software engineering is things do go wrong They go often wrong and we are running out of time If you want to launch an app on the same day that schools open, you are asking for the worst",Pure Questioning
"You have Andy saying it will get going on June 1st but fully embedded, all bells and whistles, no Which is it in your crew the 25,000 people who are needed to operate the system and deliver 10,000 track and traces per day will be in place by 1st June 24,000 of those 25,000 have been recruited already and are in advance stages of training, so will be ready to deploy on 1st June the app will be a few weeks after that, which will further augment the system We will also learn a lot more about Coronavirus by using it but we are going to be ready to go on 1st June It will really help us understand how the disease spreads",Pure Questioning
"The system is going to start on June 1st, track and trace Do you have any concerns about that from the perspective of all of the evidence pointing to children not being badly affected if they do catch it and not seemingly being as infectious as adults considering all of the measures that schools have been put in place to make sure that children are safe considering the fact that they are missing out on so much of their education by being at home all of this is about assessing risk and weighing up the different probabilities on a balance of probabilities overall after now two months at home with us trying to home educate them as well as we can while also working I think that on balance my children are better off in school",Pure Questioning
could also be the closure of many small independent theatres Do you think the government should help by bailing us out as the country starts to get back on its feet certain industries and certain companies are going to have to -- they can contribute as profitable industries can contribute substantially to the revitalising and the reopening of Britain It is incumbent upon us to sometimes have these difficult conversations with government we need to tell them the specific challenges that we are going to have in order to play that active role in reactivating the economy,Pure Questioning
Lots of schools are not What are parents supposed to make of that they are probably a bit confused by it all It is a row that has been going on I am not sure that helps parents I would agree with Helle Let head teachers sit in the driving seat and decide when it is safe to open school Parents will probably look most to head teachers for advice about safety of their kids it should also be done in consultation with local councils the circumstances will differ from one place to another in terms of the teaching staff Some of them may be self-isolating There may be issues they have to deal with when we look at the staff There will be physical circumstances at the school,Pure Questioning

"That's an important point to think about. What is the consequence for children who can't go to school. We will have children -- I mean for practically lose a whole year of education. Â  They have simply can't remember what they learned six months ago. So I am a little bit worried that if you last too long, we will be taking a little bit of the chirp's future twice.  First we will take almost a year of their education an then we are also handing them a very, very large bill for a lockdown which has become very, very expensive. So there is these balances to find but I would just again say find a good balance with also the teachers and take the heat out of it.  but I would just again say find a good balance with also the teachers and take the heat out of it. The only way this can be solved is by being pragmatic",Pure Questioning
"The only way this can be solved is by being pragmatic Claire, what do you think of what you have heard? I quite like Helle's idea of using venues creative leave.  I think what I fear is that the value of education will have been taken away from children and I think this is every child.  It is children from reception right up to the 6 formers that have lost out on their 'A' levels and are actually grieveing because of that but also I think what I fear is that there will be a distrust about social contract",Pure Questioning

" Lawrence says ""if it is safe to go back to school, why isn't it safe for the house of Parliament or are our children test subjects"" No, not at all From 2nd June, so that's a day later, these arrangements to vote remotely are being ended It is important that the national Parliament does its job scrutiniseing what the government is doing, properly asking questions Things like bill and ledge late I have submit ease haven't been sitting of the let's get Parliament working and showing leadership doing what we are asking everybody else to do, which is go to work if you safely can",Pure Questioning
"Each one was quarantined Is that the kind of level of contact tracing the government is going to be able to do from 1st June The capacity will be 10,000 traces every day The Prime Minister in the house of Commons on Wednesday was categoric We need to be ready to go on 1st June We need 25,000 people to do it 24000 have been recruited already We will get to 25,000 by 1st June We are going to get there",Pure Questioning
The app seems to be having a few teething problems Having the app is not critical to contact tracing Experience in the Isle of Wight shows you can do effective contatracing without the app the app is helpful it adds something to it and we will get that in a few weeks' time There are all sorts of other innovations happening Matt Hancock talked about a test being deployed today that gives you a result in 20 minutes We have had advances in antibody testing today as well the science is really beginning to catch up with this disease For me the science is really what gives me hope for the future hope we can move beyond the strange circumstances of the last few weeks and return to something of a normal life as the months go by,Pure Questioning
"what will be in place on 1st June will be missing many components including the contact tracing ap when can we expect to see the full implementation of test track and trace Full implemenation, according to the government anyway, is critical in terms of easing the lockdown and getting children back to school when are we going to see test, track and trace fully amounted, not just the kind of the beginnings of it, but fully implemented We have seen the new app being tested in the Isle of Wight We have learned from that experience One of the things we have learned is we can effectively deploy test, track and trace with the manual tracers We have recruited 24000 of those already We will be up to the full complement of 25,000 by 1st June the service will be fully operational on 1st June, able to track and trace 10,00from 1st June onwards The app we think will be ready to deploy a few weeks after that the two are complementary the system will work comprehensively from 1st June which is one of the government's critical test You will help us learn more about the way this disease spreads It will help us stop it spreading any further",Pure Questioning
"Full implemenation, according to the government anyway, is critical in terms of easing the lockdown and getting children back to school when are we going to see test, track and trace fully amounted, not just the kind of the beginnings of it, but fully implemented It is a really important step forward in the way we are dealing with this disease it is good news",Pure Questioning

"Yes In terms of test, track and trace how important was that in terms of Denmark being able to cope with the pandemic It was very hard It would be difficult to find someone who found it would be a good idea to wait a good week in the for the loved The lockdown simply came too late in this country that caused a lot of damage",Pure Questioning
The next thing we have to find out is how are we going to quarantine these people How is that going to happen ,Assertive Questioning

"I don't know how you would legislate for it Andy, where do you stand on the discussion about face coverings or face masks I think we are going to have to work quite hard to build confidence in the public to go back into the industries and support the cultural venues and restaurant and bars If they can help build that confidence, then why not sometimes people can see a face mask and think it is someone being distruct if you will around them As James said, it is the opposite It is quite a public spirited thing to do It is reducing the risk of you giving the infection to other people",Pure Questioning

given the success of track and trace we rely significantly on the public's trust and the Government and compliance with the rules Does the Panel feel this has been undermined in any way by the events of this last week It feels like we have done nothing else but talk about the events of the last week and of course Dominic Cummings,Pure Questioning
" why don't Labour ask for him to go Kier Starmer said clearly if he was Prime Minister, he have would have sacked him there is now over 60 MPs that have publicly said he should go There are over 70 that have e-mailed back their constituents The public are incredibly angry Douglas Ross said in his letter when he resigned this week and I think this is crucial, that many of the public have made huge sacrifices including not being able to hold the hand of loved ones when they are dying.

"Douglas Ross said in his letter when he resigned this week and I think this is crucial, that many of the public have made huge sacrifices including not being able to hold the hand of loved ones when they are dying.  How could he possibly say to his constituents they were wrong and Dominic Cummings was right do you feel compliance may have been undermined by the events of the last few days The question is really about what is the impact of that and what we have heard from our members who are CEOs of hospitals, GPs, all across the health system People are worried that public health messages are being undermined They are already hearing that people are making decisions they might not have otherwise made That's really worrying in order for these public measures, whether lockdown, test, track and trace, any of these things to work, we need to have a really clear message that's not open to too much interpretation and discretion we need to have this public feeling that we are all in it together",Pure Questioning
" Are you worried people may now -- the comment from Keith, ""move on and I don't want to talk about it anymore"" What we have seen so far is people really consciously following guidance the guidance has included recognising that some situations will be more difficult For instance, if you are looking after somebody who is particularly vulnerable, have a childcare situation",Pure Questioning
" what I am asking is whether or not you feel it would make any difference in terms of compliance generally yes, it will like Alison said, there is people with integrity out there and people who do the right thing for society and their family there is people with integrity out there and people who do the right thing for society and their family there is other people like Dominic Cummings looks for the loophole and looks for the cheap way You are cheating society by doing this Ultimately you are putting lives at risk Behaviour breeds behaviour especially with someone so influential",Pure Questioning
"all of these are key considerations as we think about what next Has it had any impact on whether you will be more or less confined as we go into test and protect or test and isolate now no, from a personal level I would follow the guidelines I've got enough integrity to do that it will have an impact on some people who are just fed up with the whole idea that someone can get away with something when the rest are not supposed to",Pure Questioning
"who are just fed up with the whole idea that someone can get away with something when the rest are not supposed to Anyone on the Panel think it wouldn't make that much of a difference it undermines the message had it been an MP, they wouldn't have got away with it If it was anyone else, they wouldn't have got away from it this person is so close and influential to Boris Johnson is what rocks my confidence",Pure Questioning
"it is not always going to be possible, particularly in a work environment When you don't know all the people you have been closer than 2-metre contact with, without the app how are you going to find them you will find a Â lot of people will know people they have spent close contact with for a sustained period of time That's what you would talk through with the tracers So they can contact them This is a known way of dealing with a pandemic and controlling it So we are not making this up This is a system that is known to work",Pure Questioning
"what really matters is us having the pandemic under control and being able to get back to life much newer to normal Is that what your constituents were saying to you when it when it first broke, this story I have received e-mails from constituents every MP has constituents who have talked about some of the sacrifices they have made and things they have missed out on I don't think we should suggest for a moment that lockdown is anything other than very hard what's really important is that we now have the infection rate under control and falling we are in a position to ease some of the lockdown measures launching NHS test and trace referred to by Alison that is so important to continuing to keep it under control we can get life going again",Pure Questioning

"Will it make a difference to prevent a second wave Does it really matter, Lisa Nandy it does matter we very much supported the government in trying to set this up if you get the app up and running it will save lives the government were warned repeatedly from the outset that the path that they were taking was not going to work the technology just wasnât compatible with a lot of phones there were other countries like Germany and Australia, who were taking a similar path to our government, trying to develop their own technology, realised that it wouldnât work, listened to those warnings, and actually went down a different path Germany has just managed to launch their app yesterday and is quite confident about how thatâs going to work weâve really got to start breaking the pattern here, which is of a government that shuts people out, doesnât listen to advice, doesnât seek to learn from expertise here in the UK and overseas, and then finds later that theyâve got to revisit those plans because theyâve unravelled very very quickly Weâve seen it over and over again with a whole host of things",Pure Questioning

"Dianeâs question is very pointed Who is managing it better I donât think you can treat this as a competition When people continue to lose their lines of business when people continue to be infected at an alarming rate we have to look across the UK there has been a similar approach taken by all four governments Around the world we are a stranger about this virus, a virus that didnât exist this time last year there have been big mistakes in Scotland we have to accept that and listen to the advice we are hearing and learn from them In Scotland we had people testing positive for Covid-19 in a hospital being discharged into a care home We have to learn from that Nicola Sturgeon told us there would be a support in September weâre still waiting in October for that We have the highest percentage of deaths in the care home setting anywhere in the UK here in Scotland no one can claim a success It is a battle that we are all still fighting It is one that continues to take lives It is one we are still trying to get on top of Thatâs just the health battle We also have the economic response to deal with as well",Pure Questioning
" Do you think that this pandemic has been managed better by Nicola Sturgeon in Scotland than it has by Boris Johnson in England Well, I donât think it is a competition because every government is responsible with the trust of the people to manage this pandemic in a way that sees the virus suppressed and also trying to manage the other harms, whether those are economic, social or other health harms Weâve seen from some of the polling, certainly even this week, that, I think, about three-quarters of people in Scotland are satisfied with the way that Nicola Sturgeon has handled the pandemic",Pure Questioning

"Thatâs the worst thing that could have happened with regard to mistakes and Nicola Sturgeon, what is the evidence that the First Minister has used in justifying her decision to crush the hospitality sector and saying the spike has come from pubs, bars and restaurant Has it been managed better by Boris Johnson or Nicola Sturgeon?

Mark, do you want to kick us off with this? Yes, sure. The first thing to say is that this virus transmits in indoor spaces more easily than it does in the outside.Â  The second thing is that, going back to the last question, the numbers arenât going down because weâre on average making too many social contacts So we know that lockdown works because when this pandemic started with tight restrictions it did come under control. Restaurants, cafÃ©s, it depends, actually, how people are seated. It depends how people behave, whether they are inside or outside. when you read through, and I read through before coming, all the different restrictions, I looked at Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, it is very confusing, and it is different. The bottom line is we need to reduce our social contacts and until we get it down similar to the levels we started with, this is not going to come under control. Frankly, we do need to get on top of the second wave and urgency does matter. we just have to get on with it and I donât think it is helpful having lots of different hard-to-understand rules.",Pure Questioning

Of course I absolutely do, and have spoken out in the past around things like the travel ban. But at the same time I think we have to recognise this election will take place next week. Itâs a decision for the American people. And our relationship with America, itâs not related to one President or one era, it goes back over generations.  There are cultural, political, economic ties, and there are huge challenges around the world, the coronavirus crisis, climate change just to name two of them that we have to work with the winner of this presidential election.

the conversation about natural immunity should be raised more often Why have we been so slow to roll-out vaccines to children vaccines should be a personal choice this idea that I know what's best for my body doesn't make a lot of sense for me I don't I'm not a doctor When there's something wrong with me I go to the people who are experts in that field,Pure Questioning
" Robin what about this idea then as you were saying, and you feel you know what's best for you So I think the issue here is it's not just about personal choice I respect personal choice, and of course, you can make your own decisions But it's a bit like people wearing masks in the audience You are not just getting vaccinated to ensure your own health It's about ensuring everybody else's health So if you were vaccinated you would be much less likely to get reinfected and much more less likely to pass it on to others It only works where everybody contributes to reducing transmission in the community",Pure Questioning
"they felt the messaging was never targeted towards them to convince them this was something they should be having Is there anything the Government or any policies that should occur to encourage people to get this vaccine take up amongst NHS staff as I have said was 95% most NHS staff took it When you look at Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) NHS staff, it's 69 there are things that we can, and should and are doing to encourage those staff to take up the vaccine engaging those community leaders in understanding the fact, and then explaining it making the vaccine present in their community through buses constantly acknowledging their concerns, and bringing those concerns to the fore",Pure Questioning

It is very concerning If you look at the levels of mortality we have in this country I do think when I talk to my public health colleagues what they say to me is be very careful about making international comparisons at this point but there are a number of different reasons as to why different countries may have different death rates For example, there is not a single universal way of recording Coronavirus and none Coronavirus",Pure Questioning

In February the UK was ranked second best to deal with the pandemic with the global pandemic security index How has the government let it happen when we have a death toll as we have It is clearly not a reason for celebration It is an extraordinary tragedy for our country and each family To see that figure today of over 3600 deaths was startling and shocking,Pure Questioning

 what did you think when the Prime Minister talked about our response to the pandemic as our apparent success It is not an apparent success Throughout this crisis we quite rightly supported the government in its aim of minimising loss of life We also called out things where we thought the government was not acting as we thought it should There are questions how well prepared the country was for this particular type of pandemic we were also slow in the lockdown slow in terms of a comprehensive test and tracing strategy there have been significant problems between what the government said is available in terms of personal protective equipment and what's actually got to the front line,Pure Questioning
"you say the government was too slow in introducing the lockdown Was Labour calling for the lockdown to be introduced earlier Yes, absolutely I was there in the House of Commons on 23rd of March we actually called for the lockdown in the House of Commons prior to it being announced later that day that was something we raised on the floor of the house that day",Pure Questioning

"Lockdown was done at the right time Why do you think then, if that is true, not according to you, we have so many deaths then it is really difficult to tell at this point I know people quite rightly want the answers there are potentially lots of answers If you look at population density, it is clearly one you raised quite correctly the fact that our social care sector has been completely neglected We know what happens in a crisis, is that the crisis inevitably finds one of weakest links in terms of the area that's been underinvested and that's not been sorted out There are some reasons I am sure All I am saying is we need to be careful about jumping to immediate conclusions on the basis of incomplete evidence at this point",Pure Questioning
" What about earlier than that Listen, what we tried to do throughout this crisis is to be supportive, Fiona You asked when we called for lockdown I was in the House of Commons the day we did The point I am making really is, of course, we will come to a point in the future when we must look very robustly with great scrutiny as to what the government is doing and what differently it could have done throughout this crisis We have to answer that question as to why we have ended up with this tragic death toll as we have at the same time we can't simply say this is something for the future I hope the government is learning lessons as it is going along on the issues of testing and tracing, on the issues of personal protective equipment to try to minimise loss of life going forward",Pure Questioning

it only launched this morning Do you know what the take up has been I don't have that data yet,Pure Questioning
what we have to ensure is that everybody who needs access to a test can get it quickly Are you confident that will happen the NHS needs to play its part We need support also from the government we exit and begin to ease lockdown it will be really important for everybody in the NHS to know the role they are meant to be playing in terms of the use of this app and supporting it,Pure Questioning

"they wouldn't need to isolate for longer than that Are they going to get tested These are things we are working through Testing along with this is an option This is why we are piloting it to work out precisely how this would work It could be very powerful because it will show where you get flare ups in particular parts of the country because lots of people will be reporting symptoms We will be able to track and monitor the virus and our success in keeping the infection rates down If there are hot spots that flare up and action is needed we will have that knowledge The crucial thing is it is not going to be storing and recording people's locations that can be identified to an individual This is a system that keeps all of that data anonymous It operates, you know, as a system that keeps people's identity in a clear of any involvement",Pure Questioning
"we need to do you think we should be doing that we are in favour of using track and trace We have been arguing a strategy on this for some considerable time now the app is very much part of that it is an essential tool as we look at that tracing strategy now going forward t is also true to say, though, it is going to require oversight",Pure Questioning

" Is it appropriate to ease the lockdown differently in different areas the first point is as Chris said, it is better if we can try and have a single approach because otherwise it does get confusing concerning some of the advice from the chief medical officer I know the prevalence can be quite different in different parts of the county the so-called R rate, the reproductive rate, is quite similar across the country The argument for having very different measures is probably not very strong There are parts of the country that have a lot of tourism There are issues about how we exit lockdown which sectors of the economy you try to tentatively open and at which stage These are factors obviously that will be taken into account in that context",Pure Questioning
"the government has said it wants to create 18,000 for contact tracing How many have been recruited so far My understanding is around 5,000 so far That's being built As we try to evolve the policy and move out of lockdown and try to get back to life as normal a track and trace system is going to be a critical tool",Pure Questioning
